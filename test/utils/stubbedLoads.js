/**
 * Stand the initialization and restore paths up without the two things a test
 * cannot supply: the network read of the `.hic` file and the canvas.
 *
 * The `.hic` read is the real system boundary here, and the only reason a
 * restore cannot otherwise be driven in a test. What stands in for it does
 * exactly what the real loader does with the parts of a config these suites are
 * about: name the dataset, and build the state from `config.state` through the
 * real `decodeState`. Everything downstream -- the registry, the browser's
 * own `toJSON`, the state itself -- is the real thing.
 *
 * The dataset it installs is `restoreDataset`, the honest hg19 stand-in #557
 * built for the restore golden, rather than a thinner one of its own. Once the
 * state goes through the chokepoint (#563) the dataset stops being decoration:
 * `clampXY` reads its chromosome sizes and `minPixelSize` reads its zoom
 * records, so a two-chromosome stand-in with no `getMatrix` is not a dataset
 * this path can be driven against at all.
 *
 * **What stubbing `loadHicFile` whole makes dark.** The replacement below is the
 * `config.state` rung and nothing else: it does not branch, so a config carrying
 * `config.locus` falls to `decodeState(undefined)`, which is `State.default()`,
 * and the locus is never parsed -- the real ladder's `parseGotoInput` rung does
 * not run here at all. And everything the real
 * `loadHicFile` does *after* the state lands is simply absent --
 * `coordinator.onMapLoaded`, the norm-vector branch, `registry.sync()`, the peer
 * search and the sync-on-load call that closes the method. No suite standing on
 * this fixture executes any of it.
 *
 * That tail ran unexercised until #626, and both of #626's causes were reached
 * through it (the defect itself was in `compareChromosomes`; the second cause
 * was `canResolveSyncState` refusing correctly but silently). A test whose
 * subject is anything past the state chokepoint has to move the seam one step
 * out, to `Dataset.loadDataset`, and let the ladder run for real:
 * `restoreDataset.js`'s header is the #557 case for doing so, and
 * `test/testSyncOnLoad.js` is the sync case. Choosing this fixture for such a
 * test is choosing to not run the code under test. #628.
 *
 * The two update paths are stubbed for the same reason `browserFixture` stubs
 * the 2D context: what a session carries is state, and every route out of a
 * repaint ends at either the network or a pixel. Rendering has its own tests.
