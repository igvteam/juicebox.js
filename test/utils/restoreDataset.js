/**
 * The dataset a restore lands on, standing in for a `.hic` file.
 *
 * `test/utils/stubbedLoads.js` stubs `loadHicFile` *whole*, which is exactly
 * wrong for #557: `loadHicFile` is the ladder under test. So the seam moves one
 * step out to the thing behind it -- `Dataset.loadDataset`, the network read --
 * and everything above it runs for real: the ladder, `browser.setState`,
 * `State.setView`, `clampXY`, `browser.minPixelSize`.
 *
 * That makes the stub load-bearing in a way `stubbedLoads`' is not. Three of the
 * numbers in the golden are read off it, so it carries real ones:
 *
 * - **chromosome sizes** are hg19's. `clampXY` bounds the origin at
 *   `chromosomes[chr].size / binSize - viewport / pixelSize`, so a made-up size
 *   would make every clamp in the file fictional.
 * - **`bpResolutions`** is the standard nine-entry juicer ladder. The corpus's
 *   harvested states carry zoom indices up to 7; a shorter array would turn a
 *   real fixture into an out-of-range one.
 * - **`getMatrix`** answers with the zoom record `browser.minPixelSize` reads,
 *   which is what puts the stated viewport into `pixelSize`.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a byte or a pixel. `getNormVectorIndex` is deliberately
 * absent rather than stubbed: `loadHicFile` guards on its presence, so omitting
 * it is how a test says "no normalization vector index", and a fixture carrying
 * `nvi=` takes that branch honestly.
