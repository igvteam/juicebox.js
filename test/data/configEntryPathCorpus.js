/**
 * The config fixtures — one input per thing an entry path is known, or
 * suspected, to treat differently. #531, the gate for candidate 9.
 *
 * Candidate 9 is "give the config schema one reader". There is one now:
 * `normalizeSession` (`js/normalizeSession.js`, #532–#536), reached once per
 * session at the entry, with `docs/config-schema.md` recording in prose what it resolves a
 * config to. When these fixtures were written there were four normalizers and
 * which of them a config met depended on the door it came in through; #533 moved
 * the last of the decoder's normalization behind the shared stage, #534 collapsed
 * the two copies of the URL-shortcut expansion into it, #535 lifted the call to
 * the entry, and #536 took the defaults out of the readers below it.
 *
 * **These fixtures carry inputs, not expected outputs** — the same rule as
 * `wireFormatCorpus.js`, and for the same reason (ADR-0006, "How we know the
 * decoder did not change"). A hand-written expectation here would encode one
 * reader's understanding of four scattered normalizers, which is precisely the
 * understanding candidate 9 exists because nobody has. The consuming test,
 * `test/testConfigGolden.js`, snapshots what each entry path actually produces.
 *
 * Every fixture is a *single browser config*, deliberately, because all four
 * columns accept that shape: the session-shaped ones read `session.browsers ||
 * [session]`, so a bare config is a one-browser session. That is what lets one
 * snapshot hold all four paths side by side and makes a divergence a visible
 * difference between columns rather than a claim in a comment. Fixtures that are
 * only meaningful as a multi-browser session are in `sessionFixtures` below and
 * run through the session-shaped paths only.
 *
 * **Every fixture here is synthesized, and that is a real limitation.**
 * `wireFormatCorpus.js` marks each fixture `harvested` or `synthesized` because
 * a synthesized-only corpus is circular: it encodes what its author thinks the
 * code accepts, and so reproduces a misreading faithfully. There is no
 * equivalent harvest available for configs — a config is an argument a host
 * passes in code, not a string a user pastes into a tracker, so there is no
 * inbound population to sample. What exists instead is the two known host apps,
 * and `host-shaped-full-config` and `empty-config` are shaped after
 * juicebox-web's call and Spacewalk's respectively (ADR-0003 measures both
 * surfaces). The non-circular half of this gate is the query suite, which drives
 * the genuinely harvested `wireFormatCorpus` inputs through the same machinery.
 *
 * `divergence` records what the fixture was written to expose. It is a note
 * about *why this input is here*, not an assertion — read the snapshot for what
 * actually happens. Where a note names a ticket, that ticket is the one expected
 * to move the snapshot.
 *
 * @see test/testConfigGolden.js — the consuming golden file
 * @see test/data/wireFormatCorpus.js — the same discipline, for the wire format
 */

/**
 * The default annotation colour, as a literal.
 *
 * Deliberately not imported from `js/sessionCodec.js`: a characterization
 * fixture that derives its input from the code under test moves when that code
 * moves, which is the one thing a gate must not do.
