/**
 * The normalize stage: a session document in, the same document resolved out.
 *
 * ## Where this sits
 *
 * ADR-0006 decision 8 names two stages, decode and normalize, and candidate 5
 * deliberately stopped at the line between them. This module is the normalize
 * side, given a name and a module of its own so that the question "what does a
 * config resolve to?" can be asked without building a browser (#532).
 *
 * #532 gave the stage its module without moving anything across the seam. #533
 * is the ticket that moves: **track-default fixing** (`fixDefaults`, which ran
 * inside `decodeSession` and so reached the URL path only), the session-shaped
 * half of the **`selectedGene` reconciliation** (#481), and the **`syncDatasets`
 * resolution** that `createBrowserList` did and `createBrowser` did not. All
 * three ran on one entry path and were skipped on another; they run here now, so
 * every door agrees. #534 finished the job with the **URL-shortcut expansion**,
 * which was written twice — once in the decoder, once in
 * `BrowserRegistry.restoreSession` — and is written once, here, now.
 *
 * #536 closed the stage: the readers below the seam stopped defaulting, and the
 * defaults they held came up here rather than being deleted -- `synchable`, the
 * background colour, `miniMode` as a spelling of `figureMode`, and `cycle` as a
 * display mode. What a resolved config carries is written down in
 * `docs/config-schema.md`; this module is the executable copy of it.
 *
 * ## Session-level and browser-level, in that order
 *
 * Two of the three moved rules are *session*-level: they read a member of the
 * document and write to the browsers under it. They run first, so a browser-level
 * rule never has to know whether the session has been consulted yet.
 *
 * ## Session-shaped, not browser-shaped
 *
 * A single-browser config is a session with its one browser inlined -- the shape
 * `createBrowserList` has always read, and the one the deleted
 * `expandSessionUrlShortcuts` walked too. Walking
 * `session.browsers || [session]` is what lets both browser-creation entry
 * points delegate to one call rather than one call per browser.
 *
 * The convention is a *reading* of a document, not a test any object passes: a
 * caller that already knows it holds exactly one browser config -- `createBrowser`
 * does -- says so explicitly, `normalizeSession({...config, browsers: [config]})`,
 * and does not have to hope the config carries no member spelled `browsers`. Note
 * what that spread buys since #533: the config's own members are the *session's*
 * members, so a session-level rule reaches a one-browser document handed in at
 * that door exactly as it reaches a document naming `browsers`.
 *
 * ## Where it is called, and how often
 *
 * Once per session, at the entry, which is #535. There are two doors and they do
 * not nest: `BrowserRegistry.restoreSession` for a session -- every
 * session-shaped path arrives there, `hic.init`, the query path and
 * `hic.restoreSession` alike -- and `createBrowser` for a single browser config.
 * Browser creation below them normalizes nothing. `test/testNormalizeOnceAtTheEntry.js`
 * counts the calls, because a second one is invisible in the result.
 *
 * ## Running it twice is the identity
 *
 * Invisible because every rule here is idempotent, which
 * `test/testNormalizeSession.js` asserts. That property was load-bearing until
 * #535 -- the restore normalized and then `createBrowserList` normalized the
 * same document again -- and it is kept deliberately now that nothing in this
 * repo depends on it: a host is free to hand the same object to `init` twice, or
 * to `createBrowser` after `restoreSession`, and the mutation is in place, so a
 * stage that drifted on a second pass would rewrite an object the host still
 * holds.
 *
 * ## "Pure" here means free of the world, not free of mutation
 *
 * No DOM, no network, no globals, no browser instance: the stage can be driven
 * from object literals, which is what `test/testNormalizeSession.js` does.
 *
 * It does mutate, and returns the document it was handed. That is deliberate and
 * is the behaviour #531 pinned: every normalizer in this codebase rewrites the
 * host's own object, so `browser.config === theObjectTheHostPassed` holds today
 * and juicebox-web reads `browser.config` back off the live instance (ADR-0003).
 * Returning a normalized *copy* would be a consumer-visible change, and it is
 * not this ticket's to make -- `sameObjectAsInput` is snapshotted in the golden
 * file precisely so that such a change has to arrive deliberately.
 *
 * ## It defaults and coerces; it never rejects
 *
 * The config object is the most-used public surface juicebox has. A normalize
 * stage that tightened validation would reject configs that work today, so no
 * ticket in candidate 9 adds validation here. `test/testNormalizeSession.js`
 * drives the inputs a validating stage would be most tempted by.
 *
 * @see docs/adr/0006-session-wire-format-and-one-decoder.md -- decision 8
 * @see test/testConfigGolden.js -- the characterization gate this must not move

 *
 * The expansion was written twice: once three call sites deep inside
 * `decodeQuery`, once as `expandSessionUrlShortcuts` reached by
 * `BrowserRegistry.restoreSession`. The second existed because of the first --
 * a session handed straight to the restore never passes through the decoder, so
 * without it a saved document spelling `*s3/` reached the loaders unexpanded.
 * ADR-0006 fact 6 recorded the duplication and decision 8 named the condition
 * for ending it: once a normalize stage exists that *both* entry paths pass
 * through, one copy is deletable. #533 met that condition and #534 deleted both,
 * leaving this.
 *
 * ## What moved, and what did not
 *
 * The set of fields is the union of what the two copies covered, which is the
 * same set: `url`, `controlUrl`, and every track's `url`. So both entry paths
 * expand exactly what they expanded before.
 *
 * What *did* move is when, and both golden files record it. `testDecoderGolden`
 * now shows a `*s3/` URL leaving the decoder unexpanded, since expansion is one
 * stage downstream of it. `testConfigGolden` (#531) -- the file that pins what
 * actually reaches a browser -- moved in exactly two columns: `createBrowser`
 * and `createBrowserList` reached directly, the two doors that never expanded at
 * all, because the copy that did lived in `restoreSession`. That is a divergence
 * closing rather than a behaviour change, and it is the reason a *deletion*
 * moves a snapshot: collapsing a duplicated rule into a shared stage necessarily
 * widens it to every caller of that stage. The probe fixture that runs the same
 * shortcut through a URL and through a config did not move, which is the claim
 * worth having -- one copy of the code produces what two produced.

/**
 * Everything a track config is resolved to, whichever door it came in by.
 *
 * Exported, unlike the rest of this module's rules, because a track has a door of
 * its own: `browser.loadTracks(configs)` is published surface and takes track
 * configs that were never part of a session. It takes a *list* rather than a
 * browser config for that reason -- there is no browser config at that door, only
 * the tracks.
 *
 * The rules were moved here from `decodeSession` by #533 (the defaults) and #534
 * (the shortcut expansion), and are unchanged: a shortcut URL is expanded, the
 * default annotation colour is dropped so the renderer's own default applies,
 * `NaN` data-range bounds are dropped rather than reaching a renderer, and
 * display mode is collapsed.
 *
 * The `NaN` sweep used to catch the common case — a v0 track string with an
 * empty data range decoded to `NaN` bounds — and #515 moved that to the decoder,
 * which now writes no bounds for a field it was never given. What is left here
 * is the malformed remainder: a half-written range (`0-`) still parses to one
 * `NaN`, and a host may hand us one directly.
 *
 * ## Which stage owns which default
 *
 * `DataLoader.loadTracks` used to default per track too, with an
 * annotation-conditioned copy of the colour and display-mode rules below. #533
 * kept both copies and justified the split by where the answer comes from; #536
 * removed the reason for it. The rules were never really about the load -- the
 * `type` they keyed on is a field of the config, not something the fetch
 * discovered -- and the one thing the loader's copy reached that this did not was
 * a track added at runtime through the published `browser.loadTracks(configs)`,
 * because such a track was never part of a session and so met no normalize stage.
 *
 * It meets one now: `HICBrowser.loadTracks` is a door, and it resolves its
 * argument through `normalizeTrackConfigs` below before handing it down. So this
 * stage owns **what the document says** for every track from either direction,
 * and the loader is left with what the *load* discovers -- `height` from the live
 * layout and `autoscale` from a missing `max`, neither of which a document can
 * answer.
 *
 * The widening that follows is the same one #533 made and is deliberate for the
 * same reason: a runtime-added track that is not an annotation now has its colour
 * and display mode resolved as a session-borne one does. Two doors, one answer.
 *
 * ## The display mode is an override, not a default, and it is kept as one
 *
 * The last line writes `COLLAPSED` unconditionally, so a track that *asked* for
 * `EXPANDED` does not get it. That is not defaulting, and this stage is
 * supposed to default -- but it is what the decoder did, verbatim, and #533 is a
 * move rather than a redecision. Two consequences, both deliberate:
 *
 * - The override is now **wider**: it used to reach only tracks that arrived
 *   through a URL, and it reaches every entry path now. #533 asks for exactly
 *   that -- "a session handed straight to `restoreSession` gets the same track
 *   defaults a URL-borne one gets ... display mode collapsed" -- because the
 *   alternative is the two doors disagreeing about the same document, which is
 *   the defect being closed.
 * - Whether to override *at all* is **#525**, open and unanswered. Nothing
 *   juicebox writes carries a track `displayMode` and no accepted wire format
 *   encodes one, so no saved link loses information today; what changed here is
 *   that the question is now about one stage rather than about which door you
 *   came in by. Softening this to `??=` is that ticket's call, and it would move
 *   the query path's snapshot too.
