/**
 * The **target set**: the browsers a *load* reaches. Not a sync group.
 *
 * `js/syncGroup.js` holds the rule for what a browser publishes its canonical
 * state to; this module holds the rule for what a track load fans out to. They
 * are two different mechanisms for "one action reaching several browsers", and
 * the distinction is the load-bearing part of the design -- membership here is
 * an explicit user gesture rather than a computed rule, the cargo is dataset
 * choices rather than canonical state, and the lifetime is until the user
 * re-aims rather than standing. See `docs/adr/0015` and `CONTEXT.md`.
 *
 * One file per mechanism, so the distinction is visible in the tree and not
 * only in the ADR. Like `pairSynchable` and `canResolveSyncState` next door,
 * everything here is a pure function over browsers: no registry, no DOM, and so
 * unit-testable against fabricated objects.

/**
 * Why this target cannot take the originating browser's tracks, or `undefined`
 * if it can.
 *
 * Two skips, and both are *skips* rather than throws -- the precedent is
 * `canResolveSyncState` (#605), which declines a state it cannot place rather
 * than failing the publication.
 *
 * - **`'no-dataset'`**: an empty browser is a normal transient state, not an
 *   error. A panel the user has opened but not yet loaded a map into is a
 *   perfectly ordinary thing to have aimed at.
 * - **`'genome-mismatch'`**: tracks carry no genome of their own, so the
 *   *originating* browser is the track's genome declaration -- the menu the
 *   track came from was built for that browser's genome. This is the skip that
 *   prevents the nasty failure: not an error, just a track drawn at meaningless
 *   coordinates in a panel nobody was watching.
 *
 * `genome` rather than `dataset.genomeId` because `genome` is what the 2D
 * loader is handed (`Track2D.loadTrack2D(config, browser.genome)`) and what a
 * 1D track resolves its chromosome names against.
 *
 * @param {Object} originating - the browser the load was issued from
 * @param {Object} target - a browser in the target set
 * @returns {string|undefined} the skip reason, or `undefined` to load

/**
 * Load `configs` into every browser in `targets` that can take them.
 *
 * Concurrent and unbounded, over `Promise.allSettled`: one gesture, N loads,
 * and no target's failure stops another's. Concurrency is deliberately *not*
 * capped here -- #588 is the unbounded-track-load problem and it deserves one
 * global answer wherever it lands, not a second, local one in this file. What
 * this feature does is multiply that blast radius, which is why #588 names it.
 *
 * Each target gets its own copy of each config, because igv mutates what it is
 * handed: `DataLoader.loadTracks` sets `autoscale`, `height`, and sometimes
 * `type`/`format` on the object it is given, and igv's own track constructors
 * keep a reference to it. Sharing one object across N browsers would let the
 * first load's discoveries leak into the rest. The copy is shallow, which is
 * what the mutation is.
 *
 * **Raises no alert.** It returns the summary and the caller reports -- one
 * report per gesture, not one modal per browser, and *where* that report
 * appears is a host's decision. juicebox-web and Spacewalk have different
 * notification surfaces. This is why the fan-out needs a loader that throws:
 * `HICBrowser.loadTracks` catches, alerts and resolves, so a fan-out over it
 * could not tell failure from success.
 *
 * @param {Object} originating - the browser the load was issued from, and the
 *   track's genome declaration
 * @param {Array<Object>} targets - the resolved target set
 * @param {Array<Object>} configs - track configs, as `loadTracks` takes them
 * @param {Function} [load] - how one browser is loaded; the seam a test drives
 * @returns {Promise<{loaded: Array, failed: Array, skipped: Array}>}
