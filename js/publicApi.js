/**
 * The declared public surface of juicebox.js.
 *
 * juicebox.js is an embeddable component, not an application. Its correctness
 * condition is not "the dev harness still works" -- it is "the host apps still
 * work, and so does an embedder we have never heard of."
 *
 * Most of that surface is not visible from inside this repo. `js/index.js`
 * exports twelve names and `HICBrowser` is not one of them: hosts get browser
 * instances from `init()` and then use them directly. So asking "does anything
 * call this?" and grepping `js/` returns *no* for members two shipped
 * applications depend on. Every refactor that trusts that grep is reasoning
 * from a false negative -- and one already has, see ADR-0003.
 *
 * This module is the fix. It names the surface as data so there is somewhere to
 * look, and `test/testPublicApi.js` reads it so there is something that breaks.
 *
 * **A name in this file is a promise.** Renaming it, removing it, or changing
 * its signature or return type is a breaking change requiring a coordinated
 * release across both known consumers -- see the release ceremony.
 *
 * **Absence from this file is not permission.** juicebox.js is MIT, published
 * and embeddable by anyone; the consumers we can measure are not the
 * population. For anything resembling a load, a session, a state or a
 * lifecycle call, prefer deprecation over deletion even when this file is
 * silent. For genuinely internal machinery, this file is sufficient.
 *
 * Nothing imports this module at runtime, so it never reaches a consumer
 * bundle. It is not in `package.json`'s `files` either -- this is repo source,
 * read here or on GitHub, not something an installed package exposes.
 */

/**
 * Names exported from `js/index.js`.
 *
 * This half of the contract is healthy: it is declared in an explicit export
 * block and used roughly as intended. It is listed here so the whole surface
 * sits in one place, and so the test can check both directions -- an addition
 * here is as much a contract change as a removal.

 * Members of the `BrowserRegistry` a host is handed.

 * A host reaches a registry two ways, both declared surface: `initRegistry()`
 * returns one, and `browser.registry` is one. Per "absence is not permission"
 * above, everything reachable on that object becomes contract the moment it
 * ships -- so the set is chosen here deliberately rather than being whatever
 * the class happens to expose. Decisions 3 and 9 of ADR-0004, #483.
 *
 * This is the multi-embed answer to the page-wide getters: a host with two
 * embeds asks a registry what its browsers are and which one is current,
 * instead of asking `getAllBrowsers()` page-wide and getting whichever embed
 * the user touched last.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* declared, and internal: `register`, `clear` and
 * `refreshDeleteButtonVisibility`, which are steps of the initialization path
 * -- a browser is registered before it is initialized, and visibility is
 * settled once -- and mean nothing to a caller outside it; and `alertDialog`,
 * which is the lazily built igv-ui dialog behind `presentAlert`. A host raises
 * an alert; which widget the registry does it with is ours to change.
 *
 * Also deliberately not declared, and new in #615: `retarget`, which is the
 * plain-click gesture (a host that wants its effect calls `select`, and the
 * clear that goes with it is the *user's* re-aim, not an API operation);
 * `isTargetedExplicitly`, which exists so `HICBrowser.reset` can carry
 * membership across its own teardown, as `releaseSlot` and `reclaimSlot`
 * already carry the slot; and the browser's own `loadTracksOrThrow`, which is
 * `loadTracks` without the alert and is what the fan-out is built on. A host
 * that wants a rejecting load should be given a declared name for it rather
 * than finding this one -- absence from this file is not permission, and
 * naming them here is what makes that decision visible.
