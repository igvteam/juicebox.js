     *
     * This is the one writer of the state field. It used to be two methods --
     * this one, and `StateManager.setState` behind it -- and #563 folded them
     * together: the manager was a wrapper re-wrapped by ten accessors here, and
     * once the behaviour left there was nothing on the far side of the
     * delegation but the field itself.
     *
     * The six canonical fields arrive off the incoming state and are handed to
     * `State.setView`. Restore used to clone and apply a bare
     * `Math.max(pixelSize, minPixelSize)` floor of its own, which meant a saved
     * view skipped the `MAX_PIXEL_SIZE` cap and the x/y clamp that every gesture
     * path gets. It no longer does.
     *
     * **A restored state is clamped silently, never rejected.** That is the same
     * rule the normalize stage one seam over follows (ADR-0006, #466): defaults
     * and coerces, never refuses. The cost is deliberate and is in the release
     * notes -- a saved view at `pixelSize=1e9`, or with an origin past the end of
     * the chromosome, now opens somewhere different. Rejecting instead would
     * turn a link that renders something into a link that renders nothing.
     *
     * The clone is what is mutated, so the caller's state object is left alone:
     * `dataLoader` hands the same instance to `coordinator.onMapLoaded`.
     *
     * The dataset must already be installed -- `clampXY` reads its chromosome
     * table and resolution ladder. All three production callers set it first,
     * one line earlier; #559 makes that ordering explicit at the call sites.
     *
     * `resolutionChanged` is computed against the state going out of force, the
     * same comparison `chrChanged` beside it makes, and for the same reason
     * (#560, ADR-0009 decision 3). It used to be `true` unconditionally, so
     * every restore announced a resolution change whether or not the resolution
     * moved. What that announcement costs is the resolution lock: the
     * coordinator releases it whenever the flag is set
     * (`browserCoordinator.onLocusChange`), and it is handed on to external
     * `onLocusChange` callbacks as contract. The repaint itself is not at stake
     * -- `update()` runs on every restore, flag or no.
     *
     * The seventh field, `normalization`, is settled after `setView` rather than
     * through it (#561, ADR-0009 decision 5): it is not one of the canonical six
     * and it is validated against the dataset rather than against the view. See
     * `#resolveNormalization` for why restore is the only place the question
     * can be asked.

    /**
     * The normalization a restored state can actually be rendered with (#561,
     * ADR-0009 decision 5).
     *
     * **Restore is the first moment this question can be asked, and the last
     * moment it can be asked cheaply.** The set of valid normalizations does not
     * exist until a dataset is loaded -- which is why candidate 9 found
     * `config.normalization` to be one of exactly three fields the normalize
     * stage provably cannot resolve, and left it alone. Downstream of here the
     * answer is still knowable but no longer actionable: `imageTileSource`
     * discovers the missing vector per tile, mid-render, and draws `NONE`
     * without the canonical state ever admitting it changed. So the state that
     * comes out of the chokepoint names a normalization the dataset has, and the
     * render path stops being where the substitution silently happens.
     *
     * It is the same invariant as the clamp, at the same moment, and it follows
     * the same rule: **coerce, never reject.** A saved link naming a
     * normalization this map does not carry still opens, on `NONE` -- the
     * fallback every `.hic` file offers. Refusing would turn a link that renders
     * something into a link that renders nothing.
     *
     * **This is validation only.** #372 -- "a normalization that is not
     * available renders without one and the user is not told" -- narrows to its
     * notification half and stays open; no error surface belongs here.
     *
     * `NONE` short-circuits, and not merely as an optimization: on a real
     * `.hic` file `getNormalizationOptions` reads the normalization vector index
     * off the wire, so asking would put a network read on every restore to buy
     * an answer that is already known. A state with no normalization at all is
     * `NONE` for the same reason `State`'s constructor defaults it there.
     *
     * A dataset that cannot answer is not a licence to skip the check:
     * `getNormalizationOptions` already answers `['NONE']` for a dataset without
     * the method, and that is a sincere answer -- such a dataset offers nothing
     * else. The one case that genuinely cannot be asked is no dataset at all,
     * and the requested value stands there rather than being coerced against a
     * set that was never consulted.
     *
     * It has two callers, not one: `init` resolves a top-level
     * `config.normalization` here too. That field is not part of any saved state
     * -- it is a config field a host sets alongside a map -- so it cannot arrive
     * through `setState`, but it is the same question against the same set, and
     * candidate 6's premise is that an invariant has one enforcer or none.
     *
     * Private, because both callers are inside this class and `js/publicApi.js`
     * is the manifest of what a host may reach. It was public on `StateManager`,
     * which was not published surface at all; landing it on `HICBrowser`
     * unmarked would have made it contract by accident, which ADR-0003's
     * "absence is not permission" is precisely about.
